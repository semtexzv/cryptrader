 - XPUB
 - XSUB
 - PAIR
 - DEALER
 - ROUTER

See the [examples folder](https://git.asonix.dog/asonix/async-zmq/src/branch/development/tokio-zmq/examples) for usage examples.

### Getting Started

```toml
futures = "0.1.25"
tokio = "0.1"
tokio-zmq = "0.9"
zmq = "0.9"
```

In your application:
```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use futures::{Future, Stream};
use tokio_zmq::{prelude::*, Rep};

fn main() {
    let ctx = Arc::new(zmq::Context::new());
    let rep_fut = Rep::builder(ctx).bind("tcp://*:5560").build();

    let runner = rep_fut.and_then(|rep| {
        let (sink, stream) = rep.sink_stream(25).split();

        stream
            .map(|multipart| {
                // handle the Multipart
                // This example simply echos the incoming data back to the client.
                multipart
            })
            .forward(sink)
    });

    tokio::run(runner.map(|_| ()).or_else(|e| {
        println!("Error: {:?}", e);
        Ok(())
    }));
}
```

### Running the examples
The `req.rs` and `rep.rs` examples are designed to be used together. The `rep` example starts a server with a REP socket, and the `req` example queries that server with a REQ socket.

The `zpub.rs` and `sub.rs` examples should be used togheter. `zpub` produces values that `sub` consumes.

The `push.rs`, `pull_push.rs`, and `pull.rs` files should be used together. `push` produces values, which are relayed by `pull_push` to `pull`, which consumes them and sends a stop signal to itself and to `pull_push`.

`sync_pubsub.rs`, `dealer_router.rs`, and `load_balancing_broker` are all self-contained, and spawn multiple threads.
